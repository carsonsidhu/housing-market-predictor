## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
The goal of this project was to predict a complex and volatile market using data scienc techniques; given the current status of the housing market,
this seemed to be a great candidate. Using data science libraries such as Seaborn, Numpy, and Pandas to parse and extract trends and relationships in housing market data, this script creates a model through multivariable regression which estimates the value of a piece of property within the geographic area corresponding to the given dataset. As a future homebuyer, I found it very insightful to inspect trends in real estate data, and note how they may correlate to different property prices

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Pandas


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Implement more flexibility in how data is processes, to allow for new types of data formats to be entered into the program, so that we may be able to make predictions with different structures of data
- Develop functionality that allows for new relationships to be formed between new types of data, further strengthening the prediction model
